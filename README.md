## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Spotify
Personalized Playlists: Spotify's algorithm creates playlists based on my listening history so that I can listen to songs that fit my taste
2. Google Map
traffic updates like where the police or traffic or even accident
3. Instagram 
reels that are closely related to what I like


I would like to create an app so that when we check out in the grocery we can scan and pay with our mobile app.
It could reduce the time of checking out and lessen the costs of having cashiers or kiosks. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I just discovered this course like 2 days ago. I do not have enough time to explore the prework while having other work. 
But I really do want to learn that is why I still submit the application to show the effort that I have made even though 
I cannot have the time to debug and take the video.
